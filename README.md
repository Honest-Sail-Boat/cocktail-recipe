# Development Branch
This brach is dedication for hosting the **Source Code** for the application. Since the application is a fullstack application, this branch will be further sub-divided into two branches:
  * frontend
  * backend

## Frontend Branch
Will contain the source code for the ReactJS application of the UI and UX.

## Backend Brach
Will contain the source code for the NodeJS application responsible for the backend.

## Access
To access each source code, one must checkout into the particular branch for development/making changes

```
git checkout frontend
```
OR
```
git checkout backend
```

## Notice !!!
It's important for the team to review the source code of both branches before deciding on merging the branches back to the parent **development** folder
